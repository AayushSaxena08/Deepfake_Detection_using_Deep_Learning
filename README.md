# Deepfake_Detection_using_Deep_Learning

Deepfakes are synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone elseâ€™s likeness. Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, are a deep-learning-based generative model. We can easily use GANs to create deepfakes which can then be misused in a number of places. Deepfakes are concerning everyone out there in the digital world. To detect deepfakes we gather the frames from the video uploaded and split the video into desired number of frames.

The project deals with detection of deepfakes using Resnet50 and LSTMs. GANs typically work with image data and use Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, as the generator and discriminator models.
